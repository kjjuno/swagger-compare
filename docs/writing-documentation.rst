Be Clear
--------

As much as possible you should strive for clear, unambiguous documentation.
Use proper english, and strive for concise explanations.

Use Examples
------------

Wherever possible try to use examples that show command line usage, or code.
Make sure any examples used actually work. There is nothing more frustrating than
following a tutorial that doesn't compile, or is out of date.

Bugs in the documentation
-------------------------

If you should find any cases in this documentation where there are typos, incorrect examples,
out dated statements, or any other "bug" in the documentation please submit an issue
to the `GitHub issues`_ site. Or, consider submitting a pull request!
